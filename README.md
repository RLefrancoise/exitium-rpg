# mmo-browser

This is an old project. It is a little Web Browser MMORPG that was supposed to be a sandbox with many features, but I just implemented very basic stuff.

It is written in PHP7 for the server. The client uses HTML5 canvas, Socket.io and WebSockets for networking.

## What is done

- Login / Logout
- Self spawn
- View other players on the same map
- Basic chat system

## What was planned to be done

- Battle system on the same map
- Inventory system
- HUD (was in progress but didn't display real info)
- Item crafting system
- Politic system
- Economy (Offer and demand system and stuff)
- Many others features all MMO can have...
